# python ICS creator for UEFA 2024

Should still be documented a bit more.

In case you want to run this, make sure the relevant python libraries are there, and your .env file is created according to '.env.example'.

It's my first Python project at age 40, please be kind :-)

## relevant links

I'm using a RAPIDAPI.com endpoint to generate the data JSONs. That code hasn't been fully implemented yet.

## Todo

- [ ] implement 'import_data' methods for all parts
  - [ ] locations
  - [ ] matches
  - [ ] teams
- [ ] clean up folder structure
- [ ] make sure this works in multiple python environments
